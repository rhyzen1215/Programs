<div style="text-align: justify;">The granting of salary-based general-purpose consumption loan is not to be considered as a regular/service open or available to the general public. This refers to unsecured loans for a broad range of consumption purposes, granted to individuals mainly on the basis of regular salary, pension or other fixed compensation, where repayment would come from such future cash flows, either through salary deductions, debits from the borrower&rsquo;s deposit account, mobile payments, pay-through collections, over-the-counter payments or other type of payment arrangement agreed upon by the borrower and lender. Bank officers are urged to exercise due discretion and to follow the provisions of this Manual.</div>
